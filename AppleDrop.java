{
    /*Player1 = mouse 
     * red apples - slow, left-click + points for p1
     * green apples - faster (variable speed, length held) left-click + more pts for p1
     * brown rotten apples - medium speed, right-click - remove pts for p2
     * 
     * Player2 = keyboard
     * 
     * left/right + <space> swatting away bad apples
     * 
     * 
     * Ideas: 
     * 
     * All speeds should be written as relative to the screen size
     * 
     * 1 point for red and then a point based on a ratio of points to speed
     * 
     * Basket should wrap around to the other side of the screen if it hits one end
     * 
     * 1 minute rounds, number can be adjusted later
     * 
     * Mac:
     * 
     * setExtendedState java
